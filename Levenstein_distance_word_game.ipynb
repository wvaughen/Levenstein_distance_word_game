    "Our aim is to create a game by generating a network of words based on levenstein distance. The goal of the game is to start with a word of a given length (e.g. a five letter word such as \"boost\") and turn it into another, predetermined word of the same length (e.g. brown) by changing one letter at a time. The goal is to get from your starting word to your end word in as few steps as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be accomplished by generating a network using levenstein distance. Levenstein distance refers to how many changes it would take to turn one word into another. As an example, the words spoon and spool would have a levenstein distance of one. We can easily create a network in which every word is represented by a node. Nodes are then connected if they have a levenstein distance of one. Once this network is created, it is simple to plot the shortest path between any two words.\n",
    "\n",
    "This network can then be used to generate interesting combinations of starting and ending words to test the player's skill."
